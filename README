Displays the boundaries of Mandelbrot and Julia sets on a pixelated
digital display accurately by guaranteeing correctness using interval
arithmetic.

The traditional method to draw fractals on a computer screen is to first
choose an iteration limit. Then, for each pixel we compute the complex
iteration of the associated fractal at a point corresponding to the
center of the pixel enough number of times to determine the nature of
the complex sequence produced at that point, but whose length is upper
bounded by the iteration limit. While this is a compromise between
accuracy and time for practical purposes, it does not make clear what
the iteration limit must be to produce the "correct" fractal boundary on
a pixelated display, where correctness is as defined below.

The problem of drawing a fractal boundary on a pixelated display is the
problem of determining the pixels through which the fractal boundary
passes and coloring only those pixels black. A drawing of this type is
"correct" (this is as precise as the display would allow us to be).
